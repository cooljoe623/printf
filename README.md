# Printf Project

This is the `printf` project for the ALX software engineering program. The goal of this project is to implement a custom version of the `printf` function in the C programming language.

## Description

The `printf` function is a widely used function in the C programming language that allows formatted output to the console or a file. The purpose of this project is to develop our own version of the `printf` function that mimics the behavior and format specifiers of the standard `printf` function.

## Usage

To use the custom `printf` function, include the `holberton.h` header file in your C program:
